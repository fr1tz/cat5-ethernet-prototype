README

  Cat5 is a A multiplayer top-down team-based tactical action game.
  Think ROTC: Ethernet meets Frozen Synapse meets Hotline Miami.
  
  This is a pre-release version of prototype 1 of the game, so there
  are still things missing, unpolished or maybe even broken.
  
  Cat5 is currently being developed single-handedly by the author of
  ROTC: Ethernet (http:/ethernet.wasted.ch) as part of a project called
  
                    1 Guy, 2 Weeks, 1 Game: Cat5
  
      http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/1-guy-2-weeks-1-game-cat5       
      
  The IndieGoGo campaign runs until the end of february 2013 and is an
  attempt to cover the author's living costs for the two weeks he's
  currently dedicating to nothing else than working on the game.

Known Issues

  - This version is not very optimized in terms of speed, but the 
    Linux version seems to run incredibly slow on systems with ATI 
    graphics drivers (to the point where it's unplayable).
