  Cat5 is a a multiplayer top-down team-based tactical action game.
  Think ROTC: Ethernet meets Frozen Synapse meets Hotline Miami.
  
  This is prototype 1 of the game, a largely untested version that's
  the result of a project called  "1 Guy, 2 Weeks, 1 Game: Cat5".
  As the name suggests, the idea behind the project was to have just
  one guy try to create a small but fun game in just two weeks.
  
  There will be bugs!

Known Issues

  - This version is not very optimized in terms of speed, but the 
    Linux version seems to run incredibly slow on systems with ATI 
    graphics drivers (to the point where it's unplayable).
