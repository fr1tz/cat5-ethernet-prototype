Cat5 0.1-dev
===================================

Cat5 is a home-made top-down multiplayer action game.
It's an attempt to create a very accessible arcade-style game
around the "Ethernet" game mode from "Revenge Of The Cats: Ethernet".

Known Issues
------------

- The game is still not very optimized in terms of speed, but the Linux version
  seems to run incredibly slow on systems with ATI graphics drivers (to the
  point where it's unplayable).
